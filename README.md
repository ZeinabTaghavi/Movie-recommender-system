based on Restricted Boltzmann Machine(generative stochastic artificial neural networks)
you can read more about RBMs in [wikipeia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restricted_Boltzmann_machine)

datasets download links are in code, if you run code without having them, will be downloaded automatically.

this model is based on this paper: [link](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/243463621_An_Introduction_to_Restricted_Boltzmann_Machines)

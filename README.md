# Movie recommender system
based on Restricted Boltzmann Machine(generative stochastic artificial neural networks)
you can read more about RBMs in [wikipeia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restricted_Boltzmann_machine)

datasets download links are in code, if you run code without having them, will be downloaded automatically.

this model is based on this conference Paper: [researchgate.net](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/243463621_An_Introduction_to_Restricted_Boltzmann_Machines) also is in my [repo](https://github.com/ZeinabTaghavi/Movie-recommender-system/blob/master/AItRBM-proof.pdf)
